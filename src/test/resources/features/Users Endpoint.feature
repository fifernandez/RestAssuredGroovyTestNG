@Users

Feature: Users Endpoint
  As a developer
  I want to be sure
  That the Users Endpoint is working as expected


  @tmsLink=01 @severity=critical
    @smoke @regression
    @1 @2 @prod
  Scenario: Verify status code returned is expected
    Given I do a get to the "users" endpoint
    Then the returned status code is: "200"
    And the schema for the "users" endpoint with "200" response code is correct


  @tmsLink=02 @severity=normal
    @smoke @regression
    @2 @3 @prod
  Scenario Outline: Verify amount of returned items is expected
    Given I do a get to the "<Endpoint>" endpoint
    Then the returned status code is: "200"
    And the response contains "<amount>" items

    Examples:
      | Endpoint | amount |
      | users    | 10     |
      | users    | 22     |


  @tmsLink=03 @severity=minor @issue=123 @Flaky
  @regression
  @4 @prod
  Scenario: Just a failing test
    Given I do a get to the "users" endpoint just to test with bad parameters
    Then the returned status code is: "205"
